# CUDA Convolution

## Description
This project was part of an assignment for a Parallel Programming with GPUs course I took during Spring 2025.

The goal was to get familiar with programming in CUDA and develop a GPU kernel that performs 2D convolution.

## How to Run
1. Download libwb and add it under the `source` directory
2. Create a new `build` directory under the root directory
3. Use the CMake GUI and set the source and build path to the `source` and `build` directories respectively and generate build files
4. Build the solution using Visual Studio and run commands inside `A2_batch.txt` to test the code on data from the `datasets` directory
